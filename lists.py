#Using Individual Values from a List

#Removing Elements from a List
#1.Removing an Item Using the del Statement

#with that item after removing it

#Popping Items from any Position in a List
first_owned = bicycles.pop(0)
print(f"The first bicycle i owned was {first_owned.title()}.")

print(bicycles) 
#Remember that each time you use pop(), the item you work with is no
#longer stored in the list.

#3.Removing an Item by Value
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized', 'mountain']
print(bicycles)
bicycles.remove("mountain")
print(bicycles)

#You can also use the remove() method to work with a value thatâ€™s being
#removed from a list.

print(bicycles)

print(bicycles)
print(f"\n A {too_expensive.title()} bicycle is too expensive for me.")
#The remove() method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify
